    p.description Finie 2.0, the “financial genie,” is a voice-enabled banking assistant that financial institutions can purchase as an out-of-the-box experience for their own customers. The original Finie is currently deployed to more than 35 million users worldwide. Right now, I’m the Design Lead on the team that’s redesigning and rebuilding it from the ground up.

    p Our marketing team had just solidified our new brand colors when the graphic designer who came up with them announced she was leaving the company for an amazing new opportunity. Not only was she a graphic designer, she was the only one at the 140-person company. We had no wiggle room on our timeline and the project had to get done. I had to jump in immediately and act as both project manager and graphic designer.
    h2 Some pages were redesigned completely.
    p We felt that a few of the pages that were most integral to the site should be redesigned completely, contributing to the overall new look and feel. For these, I worked closely with our head of marketing to map out the user experience of each page, including layout, visuals, and the copy itself.

    h2 Some pages were just “reskinned.”
    p Many of the site’s pages didn’t need much modification for this first release. For these, I simply restyled what was already there and recreated a few of the larger graphics to fit the new branding.

    h2 A work in progress.
    p The site continues to change as we iterate to satisfy changing stakeholder needs, and I’ve recently handed over the reins in order to work on other projects, such as <a href="/finie">Finie 2.0</a>.
