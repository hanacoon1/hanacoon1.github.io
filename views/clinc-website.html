Not only was she a graphic designer, she was the only one at the 140-person company. We had no wiggle room on our timeline and the project had to get done.

For these, I simply restyled what was already there and recreated a few of the larger graphics to fit the new branding.</p><img src="images/old-site.png" style="margin-top: 50px; margin-bottom: 50px;"/><img src="images/new-site.png" style="margin-top: 50px; margin-bottom: 50px;"/><h2>A work in progress.</h2><p>The site continues to change as we iterate to satisfy changing stakeholder needs, and I’ve recently handed over the reins in order to work on other projects, such as <a href="/finie">Finie 2.0</a>.</p></div><head><link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/footer.css"/></head><footer><div class="footer"><p class="made-with-love">Made with <span class="heart">❤︎</span> by Hana Coon.</p><div class="social"><a href="mailto:hanacoon@umich.edu"><img src="/images/mail.svg"/></a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hanacoon/" target="_blank"><img src="/images/linkedin.svg"/></a><a href="https://github.com/hanacoon" target="_blank"><img src="/images/github.svg"/></a></div></div></footer></head></html>
